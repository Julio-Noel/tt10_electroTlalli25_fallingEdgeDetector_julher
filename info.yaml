  description:  "This circuit is used to detect the rising and falling edge conditions when an input button is pressed. The system is clock  synchronized; x1 flipflop type D, x2 AND, and 1x NOT are used to determine the system status."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     10000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
